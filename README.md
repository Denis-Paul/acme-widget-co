# Acme Widget Co - Shopping Basket System

A Ruby implementation of a flexible shopping basket system with configurable delivery rules and promotional offers.

## Features

- **Simple Product Catalogue**: Hash-based product lookup by code
- **Flexible Delivery Rules**: Strategy pattern for extensible delivery cost calculation
- **Promotional Offers**: Strategy pattern for pluggable discount mechanisms
- **Dependency Injection**: All components are loosely coupled and testable
- **Cents-Based Calculations**: All monetary calculations use integers (cents) to avoid floating-point errors

## Design Principles

### Separation of Concerns
Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility:
- `Product`: Immutable value object for product data
- `Basket`: Shopping basket logic and total calculation
- `DeliveryRules::*`: Delivery cost calculation strategies
- `Offers::*`: Promotional discount strategies

### Strategy Pattern
Both delivery rules and offers use the strategy pattern, allowing new rules and offers to be added without modifying existing code:

```ruby
# Delivery rules implement a common interface
class DeliveryRules::Base
  def calculate(subtotal)
    # Implementation
  end
end

# Offers implement a common interface
class Offers::Base
  def apply(items)
    # Implementation
  end
end
```

### Dependency Injection
The `Basket` class accepts its dependencies through the constructor, making it easy to configure:

```ruby
basket = Basket.new(
  catalogue: catalogue,
  delivery_rule: delivery_rule,
  offers: offers
)
```

## Current Implementation

### Products
- **R01** - Red Widget: $32.95
- **G01** - Green Widget: $24.95
- **B01** - Blue Widget: $7.95

### Delivery Rules
- Orders under $50: $4.95 delivery
- Orders $50-$89.99: $2.95 delivery
- Orders $90+: Free delivery

### Offers
- Buy one red widget (R01), get the second half price

## Usage

### Running Examples
```bash
ruby bin/run.rb
```

### Programmatic Usage
```ruby
require_relative 'lib/basket'
require_relative 'lib/product'
require_relative 'lib/delivery_rules/tiered'
require_relative 'lib/offers/buy_one_get_one_half_price'

# Setup catalogue - prices are in cents to avoid floating-point errors
catalogue = {
  'R01' => Product.new('Red Widget', 'R01', 3295),
  'G01' => Product.new('Green Widget', 'G01', 2495),
  'B01' => Product.new('Blue Widget', 'B01', 795)
}.freeze

delivery_rule = DeliveryRules::Tiered.new([
  { range: 0...5000, cost: 495 },    # Under $50.00: $4.95 delivery
  { range: 5000...9000, cost: 295 },  # $50.00-$89.99: $2.95 delivery
  { range: 9000..Float::INFINITY, cost: 0 }  # $90.00+: Free delivery
])

offers = [
  Offers::BuyOneGetOneHalfPrice.new(product_code: 'R01')
]

# Create basket and add items
basket = Basket.new(catalogue, delivery_rule, offers)

basket.add('B01')
basket.add('G01')

puts basket.total # => 37.85
```

## Extending the System

The Strategy Pattern makes it easy to add new delivery rules and offers without modifying existing code.

### Example: Free Over Threshold Delivery Rule

We've implemented `FreeOverThreshold` - free delivery when order exceeds a threshold:

```ruby
class DeliveryRules::FreeOverThreshold < Base
  def initialize(threshold_cents:, standard_cost_cents:)
    @threshold_cents = threshold_cents
    @standard_cost_cents = standard_cost_cents
  end

  def cost_for(subtotal_cents)
    subtotal_cents >= @threshold_cents ? 0 : @standard_cost_cents
  end
end

# Usage: Free delivery on orders $75+, otherwise $6.95
delivery_rule = DeliveryRules::FreeOverThreshold.new(
  threshold_cents: 7500,
  standard_cost_cents: 695
)
```

### Example: Bulk Discount Offer

We've implemented `BulkDiscount` - discount when buying 3+ of the same item:

```ruby
class Offers::BulkDiscount < Base
  def initialize(product_code:, min_quantity:, discount_per_item_cents:)
    @product_code = product_code
    @min_quantity = min_quantity
    @discount_per_item_cents = discount_per_item_cents
  end

  def apply(items)
    matching = items.select { |i| i.code == @product_code }
    return 0 if matching.count < @min_quantity
    
    matching.count * @discount_per_item_cents
  end
end

# Usage: Buy 3+ Green Widgets, save $2.00 per item
offer = Offers::BulkDiscount.new(
  product_code: 'G01',
  min_quantity: 3,
  discount_per_item_cents: 200
)
```

### Running Extended Examples

```bash
ruby bin/run_extended_examples.rb
```

This demonstrates:
- **FreeOverThreshold**: Orders under $75 pay $6.95 delivery, $75+ get free delivery
- **BulkDiscount**: Buy 3+ Green Widgets at $2 off each ($24.95 â†’ $22.95)
